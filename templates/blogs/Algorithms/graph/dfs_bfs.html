    <p>There are two main methods when it comes to searching graph data structures, trees, string, and much more which
        are 
        <b>depth first search</b> and <b>breadth first search</b>. 
    </p>

    <h5 id="1">Depth First Search</h5>
    <p>DFS for short uses stack data structure(LIFO) and it is edge based technique. Its goal is to find 
        unvisited vertex then go down deep until no more vertex to visit then move backwards until there
        is another vertex to visit that has not been visited already.
    </p>
    <p>
        In real life it is like hiking a trail with multiple split trail. You would  
        make a choice at each split trail until you meet a dead end, and at that time you would go backwards
        to previous split way and from there you would goto other way if that way was not visited already.
    </p>
    
    <p>Lets go through DFS using a graph below by following:
        <ol>
            <li>Find a vertex to perform DFS, mark it as visited, insert into the stack and if it is visited
                we output it.</li>
            <li>Goto adjacency vertex and repeat step 1.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 2 until no adjacency vertex or adjacency vertex has been visited already, 
                pop that vertex out of stack and move backwards until there is another vertex to visit.
            </li>
            <li>While going back if vertex has vertex to visit repeat steps 1~3 else pop it from stack. If stack is empty 
                we are done. </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/dfs_1.png" alt="">
    <p>
        <b>1.</b> choose a vertex to perfrom DFS, I will choose vertex A. Mark it visited, output it and 
        insert into a stack.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/dfs_2.png" alt="">
    <p>
        <b>2.</b> There are two adjacency vertex that have not been visited, you could pick either one but 
        I will go ahead in alphabetical order and choose vertex B. <br>
        <b>3.</b> following step 2 we get B -> D -> E -> G.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/dfs_3.png" alt="">

    <p>
        <b>4.</b> Now since G has no adjacency vertex we pop it and go back its path.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/dfs_4.png" alt="">

    <p>
       Now we are at vertex E. Its only adjacency vertex is G but has been visited already so pop it.<br>
       Similiary pop vertex D, B.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/dfs_5.png" alt="">

    <p>Now since vertex A has unvisited adjacency vertex C repeat steps 1~3.<br>
        <b>1.</b> Goto vertex C, mark it visited, insert to stack and output it.<br>
        <b>2.</b> We are at vertex C. Since D has been visited we go down to F. <br>
        <b>3.</b> We are at vertex F. No vertex to visit so time to go backwards.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/dfs_6.png" alt="">

    <p><b>4.</b> Pop F, C. Now we are left with vertex A its adjacency vertex all been visited so pop it.</p>
    <img src="../photos/dfs_7.png" alt="">

    <p>You can see that our stack is empty which implies that all vertices has been visited thus we just 
        successfully finished depth first search.
    </p>

    <h5 id="2">Breadth First Search</h5>
    <p>BFS is often used for finding shortest path, or whether or not there exists path between two verticies.
        It is vertex based technique and uses queue data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike DFS where it goes deep down into one path BFS searches layer by layer, considering all
        other possibilities before going deeper down. One application of BFS can be seen in social network where your direct friends
         would be considered layer 1 and friends of friend are in layer 2 because you cannot reach them directly but
         through your link(friend) and so on...
    </p>
    <p>For simplicity we will use same graph from DFS example and perfrom BFS this time by following following
        steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Find starting point mark it as visited and insert into queue.</li>
            <li>Following FIFO delete first item(vertex) in queue. Insert deleted vertex's adjacent 
                vertex into queue and mark them as visited.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat step 2 until queue is empty.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p><b>1.</b> Choose starting point, vertex A. Mark it visited and insert into queue.</p>
    <img src="../photos/bfs_1.png" alt="">
    <p><b>2.</b> delete first item in queue which is vertex A and insert all its adjacency vertex and mark them
    as visited. Doesn't matter which vertex to insert first but we will just follow alphabetical order and insert
    vertex B first.</p>
    <img src="../photos/bfs_2.png" alt="">
    <p>
        Now first item in queue is B. Delete it and insert its adjacent vertices into the queue and mark them visited.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/bfs_3.png" alt="">
    <p>Repeating the steps, we will delete vertex C from queue and insert its adjacent vertices but since
        D is already visited, just insert F. <br>
        Do the same for vertex D: since E is visited insert G into the queue.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/bfs_4.png" alt="">
    <p>Now we have delete E, F, G in order and since all of them have no unvisited adjacent vertex
        nothing to insert to queue and it becomes empty.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/bfs_5.png" alt="">
    <p>Now we have successfully done breadth first search. If you at deleted vertex we can see that 
        they are in order of their depth, vertex A have depth 0, {B,C} have depth = 1, {D, E, F} have depth = 2,
        and finally {G} has depth =3. <br>

        So we searched all friends first, then friend's friends, and so on...
    </p>
    <!-- <p>Choosing the starting point depends on what problem you are using BFS to solve for example if you want to
        find shortest path between two path, in directed graph (u, v) vertex U would be the starting point.
