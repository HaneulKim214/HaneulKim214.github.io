    <h5 id="1">Topological sort</h5>
    <p>By definition topological sort is linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v),
        vertex u must come before v in the ordering.
    </p>
    <p>One simple analogy is taking courses in University. Most courses have pre-requisites therefore
        you must satisfy all pre-requisites before taking more advanced course. Topological sort would
        be used for ordering courses so that pre-requisites would be met. 
    </p>
    <p>Before moving on to an example note that topological sort only works when graph is <b>directed acyclic graph (DAG)</b>.</p>
    <p>Let's go through an example. Looking at graph below we notice that it is directed and acyclic.</p>
    <p>lets think of each vertex as courses we need to take in order to graduate, course B and E needs 
        A as pre-requisite and C need B as pre-requisite and so on...
    </p>
    <p>Topological sort has lots of applications in real world, some of them are build systems, advanced-packaging tools, task scheduling, pre-requisite
        problems and anything that need an ordering where previous jobs must be done to move on.
    </p>

    <p>Now we know what topological sort is, lets talk about how it is done. There are two different methods
        of performing topological sort, first we will use lists and second use Depth First Search.
    </p>
    <h6 id="1-1">Lists method</h6><nober style="color:red">What is the proper name for list method??</nober>

    <p>
        Topological sort using a list follows simple 3 steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Create a list for storing vertices</li>
            <li>Insert vertex with 0 in-degree(no incoming edge) into list and delete vertex and its edges(out-going edge since we pick vertex with no incoming edge).
            </li>
            <li>Repeat step 2 for all vertex until no more vertex is left in a graph.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>Pretty simple right? Lets clarify our understanding by going over simple example.</p>
    
    <h6 id="1-2">Depth First Search methods</h6>
    <p>
        For those of you needing quick recap on what DFS is, check out <a href="dfs_bfs.html">Depth/Breadth First Search</a> before
        moving on.
    </p>
    <p>Assuming you know <b>exactly</b> what DFS is lets use it to perform topological sort. Similar to using list method
    there are simple 3 steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Create a list</li>
        <li>Perform DFS on vertex with no incoming edge, upon DFS if you are at a vertex with no adjacent vertex to 
            goto, insert that vertex into list.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat step 2 until no more vertex to visit.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Let's go through an example to understand more deeply.</p>
