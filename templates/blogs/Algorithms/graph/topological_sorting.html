    <h5 id="1">Topological sort</h5>
    <p>By definition topological sort is linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v),
        vertex u must come before v in the ordering.
    </p>
    <p>Topological sort has lots of applications in real world, some of them are build systems, advanced-packaging tools, task scheduling, pre-requisite
        problems and anything that need an ordering where previous jobs must be done to move on.
    </p>
    <p> One common analogy could be getting ready to go outside. A person needs to 1. take a shower 2. put on underwear 3. pants and so on...
        This is an example of topological sort where each activity such as shower, underwear, pants can be 
        thought of as a vertex and edge that allow the person to go from shower then underwear. Topological
        sort is used to order activities that need specific execution order. 
    </p>

    <p>Before moving on to an example note that topological sort only works when graph is <b>directed acyclic graph (DAG)</b>.
        It is very intuitive, if you would have a cycle then you would be stuck taking shower -> putting on underwear -> shower
        on and on thus it wouldn't be possible.
    </p>

    <p>Now we know what topological sort is, lets talk about how it is done. There are two different methods
        of performing topological sort.
    </p>
    <h6 id="1-1">Lists method</h6><nober style="color:red">What is the proper name for list method??</nober>

    <p>
        Topological sort using a list follows simple 3 steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Create a list for storing vertices</li>
            <li>Find vertex with 0 in-degree(no incoming edge) then insert
                 into list. Delete inserted vertex from graph and its
                  edges(out-going edge since we pick vertex with no incoming edge).
            </li>
            <li>Repeat step 2 for all vertex until no more vertex is left in a graph.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>Pretty simple right? Lets clarify our understanding by going over simple example.</p>
    <p>Below graph is directed and has no cycles therefore lets perfrom topological sort!</p>
    <img src="../photos/topo_sort_1png.png" alt="">

    <p>There are two vertex that have 0 in-degree. Doesn't matter which one we choose first so
        let's just go on and pick vertex A. Delete vertex and edges and insert vertex into a list.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/topo_sort_2.png" alt="">
    <p>Now vertex B and D have 0 in-degree, this time let's pick B.</p>
    <img src="../photos/topo_sort_3.png" alt="">

    <p>Next lets choose Vertex E.</p>
    <img src="../photos/topo_sort_4.png" alt="">

    <p> Choose D.</p>
    <img src="../photos/topo_sort_5.png" alt="">
    <p>You get the point... Now I will choose G, C, F, lastly H giving us list = [A, B, E, D, G, C, F, H].
        Now we are done! If you check the list we've just created they are ordered so that for every directed
        edge (u,v) vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
    </p>
    
    <h6 id="1-2">Depth First Search methods</h6>
    <p>
        For those of you needing quick recap on what DFS is, check out <a href="dfs_bfs.html">Depth/Breadth First Search</a> before
        moving on.
    </p>
    <p>Assuming you know <b>exactly</b> what DFS is lets use it to perform topological sort.
         Similar to using list method there are 3 simple steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Create a list</li>
        <li>Perform DFS on vertex with no incoming edge, while performing DFS
             if you reach vertex with no adjacent vertex, insert that vertex into list and mark it as "visited"
        </li>
        <li>Repeat step 2 until no more vertex to visit.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Let's go through an example to understand more deeply.</p>
    <p>I will use same example as before however I will choose vertex B first and perform DFS.
        B - C - F - H since H has no adjacency vertex, not G because vertex G and H has path (G,H).<br>
        Insert H into our list and mark H as visited.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/topo_sort_6.png" alt="">
    
    <p>Now going backwards we visit vertex F. Its only adjacency vertex is H however it is "visited" therefore
        it has same as having no adjacency vertex. Insert vertex F into our list and mark it "visited". Do the same
        for vertex C, now we are at vertex B. It has two adjacency vertex C and E but since C is visited
        lets move down B - E - G.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/topo_sort_7.png" alt="">
    <p>Vertex G has one adjacency vertex H, it has been visited already so insert G into our list. 
        Moving back to vertex E it has adjacency vertex G but has been visited so insert E into our list.
        We are back to vertex B which had two adjacency vertices but both are visited therefore insert B into
        our list.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/topo_sort_8.png" alt="">
    <p>We have list = [H, F, C, G, E, B] so far.
    </p>

    <p>Repeating step 2 only unvisited vertex with no incoming edge is vertex B.
        There are two paths but only unvisited path is A - D moving down its path we stop at vertex D
        since its adjacency vertices are visted therefore insert D into our list. Finally insert vertex A
        into our list. As you can see now we have visited all vertices and left with 
        list = [H, F, C, G, E, B, D, A].
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/topo_sort_9.png" alt="">

    <p> NOTE: since list is in reverse order, reverse it.<br>
        Finally reversted_list = [A, D, B, E, G, C, F, H] correctly sorted all vertices so that
        for every directed edge (u,v) vertex u comes first in the list.  
    </p>
    <p>Some people probably realized that two different method output different ordering. It is not because
        of difference in methods however topological sort can have multiple sorting order. <br>
        In our case we could've started with vertex A or B which will give two different sorted list.
    </p>
