    <h5 id="1">Topological sort</h5>
    <p>By definition topological sort is linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge (u,v),
        vertex u must come before v in the ordering.
    </p>
    <p>One simple analogy is taking courses in University. Most courses have pre-requisites therefore
        you must satisfy all pre-requisites before taking more advanced course. Topological sort would
        be used for ordering courses so that pre-requisites would be met. 
    </p>
    <p>Before moving on to an example note that topological sort only works when graph is directed acyclic graph (DAG).</p>
    <p>Let's go through an example. Looking at graph below we notice that it is directed and acyclic.</p>
    <p>lets think of each vertex as courses we need to take in order to graduate, course B and E needs 
        A as pre-requisite and C need B as pre-requisite and so on...
    </p>
    <p>So our goal is to order courses so that unsatisfied pre-requisite problem never arise.</p>
    <img src="../photos/top_sort_1.png" alt="">
    <p>There are two ways of performing topological sort which are by using:
        <ol>
            <li>Stack</li>
            <li>Queue</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>First we will go over above example by using stack data structure following steps below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a starting point, vertex with lowest in-degree.</li>
        <li>mark starting point as "visited" and go to next neighbour.</li>
        <li>now mark 2nd vertex as "visited" and move to its neighour</li>
        <li>follow these steps until vertex with no out-going edge is found</li>
        <li>input vertex with no out-going edge into the stack and move backwards</li>
        <li>repeat above steps until no more vertices are left.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    <b>1.</b>Vertex with lowest in-degree is vertex A. So mark A visited and move onto its neighbour,
        either B or E does not matter.<br>
        <img src="../photos/top_sort_2.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2.Goto next neighbour vertex B, mark it "visited" and move on</b><br>
        <b>3,4.Visit neighbours until vertex has no out-going edge.</b>
        <img src="../photos/top_sort_4.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <p><b>5.</b> Since H do not have any out-going edge insert into stack.</p>
    <img src="../photos/top_sort_5.png" alt="">
    <p>Now j has no out-going edge so insert it to stack
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/top_sort_6.png" alt="">
    <p>Keep moving backwards and insert into stack accordingly thus left with vertex E and F.</p>
    <p><b>6.</b> Repeating steps on remaining graph.</p>
    <img src="../photos/top_sort_7.png" alt="">
    <p><b>1.</b> Vertex E has 0 in-degree and F has 1 in-degree. Start from vertex E, mark it visited and move on.
    Since F is last vertex with no out going edge stop there and move backwards inserting F then E into the stack.</p>
    <img src="../photos/top_sort_8.png" alt="">
    <p>We are done ordering vertices. Since it is in stack data structure we need to </p>
