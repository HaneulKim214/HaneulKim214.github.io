    <h5 id="1">What is dynamic programming?</h5>
    <p>

        Dynamic programming is a method we use to solve particular problems that can be broken down into sub problems. This
        sounds exactly like divide and conquer technique however a problem needs to has additional condition even though with out the 
        condition a problem can be solved using dynamic programming it wouldn't be efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        After all reason for using some kind of technique in computer science is to increase efficiency. In order to 
        benefit from dynamic programming technique a problem should satisfy two additional conditions then questions that
        can be solved by divide and conquer:
        <ol>
            <li>Optimal substructure:
                <p>
                    larger/later subproblems require answers from previous sub problem's answers.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Overlapping sub-problems:
                <p>
                    subproblems are reused several times
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        So why so many conditions? <br>
        Dynamic programming works in following steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Split problem into subproblems and order them in "must be solved first" -> "solved last" subproblems</li>
            <li>Solve from first to last and store answers into a table.</li>
            <li>Use answers stored in table to solve next subproblem and so on</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason for storing answers in a table is because since we use dynamic programming on questions that have overlapping sub-problems
        and sub problem depend on previous answers we do not want to calculate already solved problem again. By storing it in a table we can 
        avoid computing same problem again.
    </p>
    <p>
        So if a problem does not satisfy conditions we could still use dynamic programming approach but there is no point
        in storing answers of subproblems into a table, it would be total waste of space since those answers will not be used to solve 
        other subproblems.
    </p>
    <p>Now that you know what dynamic programming is and where to use it, let's talk about two different types of dynamic programming
       <b>Tabulation</b> and <b>Memoization</b>.
