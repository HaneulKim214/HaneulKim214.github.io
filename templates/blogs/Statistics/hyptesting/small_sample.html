    <h5 id="1">Hypothesis testing on small sample</h5>
    <p>
         A new pharmaceutical company recently invented a drug to cure covid-19 virus. They say that their drug has an effect 90% of the time. You are very skeptical, you believe that drugs' effectiveness
         must be less than 90% and want to test it yourself. You've
         gathered 15 sample 11 people were cured and 4 people were not cured. So is the drug effective 90% of the time?
    </p>
    <p>
        To answer this question we will use Hypothesis testing in steps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 1: State Null and Alternative Hypothesis. <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial belief = Null hypothesis(Ho) = P(drug effective) = 0.9</li>
            <li>Your belief = Alternative hypothesis(Ha) = P(drug Not effective) &lt; 0.9 </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 2: Find test statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Test statistics is a parameter of sample we will use to reject or approve null hypothesis.
        
        When person is given a drug they are either cured (with 90%) or not cured (with 10%) according to the pharmaceutical company. This as you can tell is a 
        <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/binomial-theorem/binomial-distribution-formula/">binomial distribution</a> so based on initial belief of the company
        our probability distribution would be X ~ B(15, 0.9). Remember that since we assume null is true, we've set cure rate as 0.9.
    </p>

    <p>
        Step 3: Set alpha and find p-value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next we set alpha also known as level of significance to be 0.05. Reason we are setting alpha before calculating p-value is to reduce bias since if you caluculate p-value first you may 
        set alpha to reject or not reject which ever way favors you.
    </p>
    <p>
        P-value, given cure rate is 0.9 (assuming null is true) why unlikely is the outcome that only 11/15 = 0.73 = 73% are cured? so if p-value is 0.03 it means that our outcome will happen only 3% of the
        time if we run same experiment on same number of sample 100 times which is very unlikely.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what is probability that less than or equal to 11 people cured is a outcome? P(X &lt;= 11)?
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this is binomial distribution:
        <br> P(X &lt;= 11) = 1 - P(X &gt;= 12)<br>
        P(X &lt;= 11) = 1 - ( [(15C12) * (0.1^3) * (0.9^12)] <b>+</b> [(15C13) * (0.1^2) * (0.9^13)] <b>+</b> [(15C14) * (0.1^1) * (0.9^14)] )
        P(X &lt;= 11) = 0.0555
    </p>

    <p>Step 4: Draw conclusion</p>
    <p>
        Assuming null is true our probability of our outcome of 11/15 cured occuring is 0.055. This is greather than our alpha 0.05 therefore we cannot reject null hypothesis thus null is true.
        We conclude drug is effective 90% of the time.
