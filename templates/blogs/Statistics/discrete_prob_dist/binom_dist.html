    <h5 id="1">Binomial distribution</h5>
    <p>
        I think probability distributions are really useful in understanding things that happen in real life. When young 
        most people probably have been questioned "What is the proability of flipping 3 heads in 5 flips?" or something similar. However
        not many knew the answer or even if they did they could not solve similar questions that had more trials.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is exactly where <b>Binomial distribution </b>can help. It is one type of discrete probability distribution, for those of you 
        who do not know that discrete proability distribution is, refer to previous blog on <a href="geo_dist.html">Geometric distribution.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Binomial distribution is probability distribution of binomial random variable. Say you are flipping 10 coins(binomial experiment)
         and want to find out probabilty of getting "n" number of heads where "n" is any positive integer between 0~10. You would get
         probability of getting 1 heads, 2 heads, 3 heads and so on... number of heads are denoted as X, random variable. Finding all 
         probability of these random variables and distributing them into a table or a bar chart is called a probability distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain conditions must be satisfied for probability of random variables to be called binomial distribution.
        <ol>
            <li>All trials must be independent and all trials have equal success rate</li>
            <li>Each trial is binomial experiment (having only two outcomes)</li>
            <li>Fixed number of trials.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h6 id="1-1">Deriving formula</h6>
    <p>
        Let's say a I have 30% chance of making a 3-point shot, which makes 70% of missing 3-point shot. I want to know probability of
        myself making 2 shots in 5 tries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Probability of scoring 2 shots and 3 shots can be interpreted as (0.3)(0.3)(0.7)(0.7)(0.7) since probability of scoring is 0.3 and missing is 0.7. 
        Denoting scoring as <b>S</b> and miss as <b>M</b> gives us <b>SSMMM</b> but there are multiple ways of scoring two 3-pointers. It can be
        SMMMS, SMMSM, SMSMM, and so on... 
    </p>
    <p>
        So probability of scoring 2/5 must be multiplied by number of ways it could be scored.
        <br><br>
        Number of ways two 3-pointer could be scored can be calculated using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8vIcmr_Pqo">combinatorics</a>
        <img src="../../../../blog materials/statistics/combination.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>There are 10 different ways two 3-pointers can be made. Now multiplying it with probability of making 2 shots would be 
        <img src="../../../../blog materials/statistics/binom_dist_ex1.png" alt="">
        which equals to 0.3087 = 31%. I would make 2/5 3-pointers with 31% chance.
    </p>
    <p>
        We always want to generalize our formula so we don't reinvent the wheel.<br>
        Notice that # of ways 2 shots can be made in 5 tries where 5<span style="font-size: x-large;">C</span>2 so if we want to 
        find # of ways "r" shots can be made in "n" trials our formula can be generalized to n<span style="font-size: x-large;">C</span>r.
    </p>
    <p>
        We know that probability of success is often denoted as <b>p</b> and failure as <b>q</b> = 1-p.
    </p>
    <p>Combining them we get generalized formula for binomial distribution.<br>
         <img src="../../../../blog materials/statistics/binom_dist_formula.png" alt="">
    </p>

    <h6 id="1-2">Example</h6>
    <p><b>Q:</b> Find proability of getting 2 heads in 6 coin flips?</p>
    <p>
        n = 6, total number of trials. Success is getting heads meaning flipping tail is considered failure. Each trial is independent and 
        has equal probability of success therefore it satisfied two conditions of binomial distribution. Lastly since we are working with fixed 
        number of trials we satisfy all three conditions allowing us to use binomial distribution formula.
    </p>
    <img src="../../../../blog materials/statistics/binom_dist_example.png" alt="">
    <p>
        <b>A:</b>Probability of getting 2 heads in 6 coin flips is 23.4%
    </p>

    <h5 id="2">Cumulative Binomial distribution</h5>
    <p>Previous example only considers exact random variable. If we want to find probability of getting 2 or 3 heads in 6 coins flips
        we simply add P(X=2) + P(X=3).
    </p>
    <p>
        To find probability of getting 3 heads or less we simply add all probability of random variables 0,1,2,and 3.<br>
        <img src="../../../../blog materials/statistics/cum_binom_dist.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>Very simple right? Now we know how powerful binomial distribution is lets look at some limitations.</p>
    <p>
        Let's say you want to find probability of getting less than or equal to 50 heads in 100 coin flips. It would be same as before however 
        there are 51 different probability you need to calculate and sum which can be very cumbersome and prone to error. As number of trial 
        gets larger and as number of probabilities of random variable we need to sum gets larger it gets harder and harder to calculate without 
        using a program.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, I will explain how limitation of binomial distribution can be alleviated by help of normal distribution.
