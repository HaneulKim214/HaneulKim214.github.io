    <h5 id="1">What is discrete probability distribution?</h5>
    <p>
       It is a proablility distribution for finite number of outcomes. Then what is proability distribution? It is a "probability" for each possible outcomes.
       For example when rolling a die there is 6 finite number of outcomes(discrete) and if you calculate probability of rolling 1, 2, 3, ..., 6(all possible outcomes)
       all probability distributed are dicrete probability distribution of rolling a 6-sided die.
    </p>

    <p>
        Above is discrete probability distribution of rolling 6-sided die. P(X=x) is a notation for proability of variable x happening. So P(X=1) implies what is
        the probaility of rolling a one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Calculating probability of rolling a die seems unnecessary since it is very intuitive. But what if someone asks you for the probaiblity of rolling
        die 100 times and getting 1 for the first time? It is not very intuitive, but with help of discrete probability distribution we can make in more intuitive 
        and by help of special discrete probability distribution it will make calculations easier.
    </p>
    <h5 id="2">Geometric distribution</h5>
    <p>
        Geometric distribution is used for finding proability of succeeding for 1st time. But in order to use it for such problem our data must be in geometric distibution.
    </p>
    <p>Our data follows Geometric distribution when:
        <ol>
            <li>independent trials --> previous trial does not affect next trial's probability of succeeding.</li>
            <li>Binomial outcome --> like "yes" or "no, only two possible outcome.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        If it follows two conditions above we can make use of geometric distribution to solve our problem. Lets go over an example.
    </p>
    <p>
        Q: Your goal is to roll 10-sided die and findout how many rolls produce highest probaility of roll a 1 for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Rolling a die are independent since rolling one die would not affect outcome of next roll.<br>
        2. People might be saying that there are 10 possible outcomes therefore it does not satisfied 2nd condition. <b>However</b> in our questions our goal is 
        getting 1, therefore we could simply make it in to "yes" or "no" question. If die rolls a 1 it is a "yes" otherwise it is a "no".
    </p>

    <p>First thing you need to do is caluate probability of success and failure.
        <ul>
            <li>In our case success = rolling a 1. Since it is 10-sided die probability of rolling a 1 would be 1/10 = 10% denoted as p = 0.10.</li>
            <li>Any other outcome would be a failure therefore
                1 - 0.1 = 0.9 = 90% denoted at q = 0.9.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Then we can find probaility of getting 1st success after "r" trials for any r by using formula called gemotric distribution.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="../../../../blog materials/statistics/geo_dist_formula.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>
        X stands for random variable in our case number of trials denoted by r. p = success probability and q = failure probability.
    </p>
    <p>
        P(X=1) = proability of succeeding in 1st trial = (q^r-1)p = (0.9^0)(0.1) = 0.1 which makes sense since rolling a 1 is 1/10. <br>
        P(X=2) = proability of succeeding in 2nd trial, and by using this formula we could find probaility of any P(X=r).
    </p>
    <p>
        Simply you could think of P(X=r) as "how many times do I need to fail in order to succeed on rth trial?" so P(X=9) would mean I need to fail 9-1=8  times thus q(probaility of fail)^8 then 
        after 8 failure you will succeed therefore multiple probaility of success hence we get the formula P(X=r) = q^(r-1)p
    </p>
    <p>
        Geometric distribution can be depicted using a tree
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="../../../../blog materials/statistics/geo_dist_tree.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>
        If you fail once then succeed first you go down to q then to p thus (0.9)(0.1) if you fail two times then succeed it would be (0.9)(0.9)(0.1). It is just a way of visualizing gemoetric distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we can answer our question. As we fail once we must multiple by proability of failure to probability of success and since q is never 1 probability must only decrease therefore
        we can conclude that rolling a die 1 time has highest probability of getting a 1 for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is always true for geometric distribution, probability of 1st success is the highest in only one trial. Always in shape of right skewed distribution where x-axis = number of trials
        and y-axis = probability of 1st success.
